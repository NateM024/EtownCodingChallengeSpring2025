The course is based on the study of local history as a means for Honors students to examine the people who built the local community. Through the study of local history, students will gain an appreciation of the importance and context of place and how their own contributions impact the larger community. Students' research findings will be shared publicly through an ArcGIS electronic story map. This resource with the students' research is used by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Federal Department of Transportation to inform decisions made in the Section 106 National Historic Preservation Review for the National Historic Preservation Act. Students will engage in hands-on projects in areas such as oral history, archival research, and grant writing and personally engage with members of the campus and local communities through field trips, site visits, and guest lectures. As a primary feature of this course, the local community (the College campus, Elizabethtown Borough, and Lancaster County) will serve as a learning laboratory.

Game design is not about the mechanics of the production of technology. Modern gaming culture has integrated concepts of home and nation, war and memory, social norms and their threats, as well as bioethics in the very conceptualization of its structure. Therefore, it is essential we study these concepts holistically. Japan and other Asian cultures have become synonymous with the production of games in all their forms, whether they are role-playing games (RPG), videogames, or PC-based strategy games. In fact, the image of Japan has morphed from the producer of ‘hard’ technology that it used to have–dominating the automobile, computer, and photographic industries–to one of a ‘cool’ producer of videogames, anime, manga, and other pop culture goods. 
This course will involve students in the education of this integration with hands-on production of designing, creating, and analyzing games of various genres that have both Western and Japanese sensibilities. It is hoped that this integrative process will allow them to understand the subtle nuances of Asian cultures as well as how it differs in its orientation from Western ones.</p><br><hr><br><p>Credit Type: Letter Graded</p>Signature Learning: <p>Additional Fees: 0.00</p><p></p><p>Course Reminder:</p><p></p> Program Category: (Ground 0-25%)</td>

This research seminar will provide sophomores in the Honors program with an understanding of the practice of local history and an understanding of local history's relationship to other branches of historical studies as well as a wide variety of academic disciplines. The course is based on the study of local history as a means for Honors students to examine the people who built the local community while they, as sophomores, discern the path of their own educational and life journey. Honors students will research local history, write about local history, reflect on their research about local history and their own lives, and share their knowledge of local history and what they have learned about their own personal development both as individuals and as leaders on campus. Through the study of local history, students will gain an appreciation of the importance and context of place and how their own contributions impact the larger community. In keeping with the themes of real world learning, signature learning experiences, and community-based learning, students will have the opportunity to develop their own hands-on projects in areas such as oral history, archival research, and grant writing and personally engage with members of the campus and local communities through field trips, site visits, and guest lectures. As a primary feature of this course, the local community (the College campus, Elizabethtown Borough, and Lancaster County) will serve as a learning laboratory.onors students will learn how to take notice of the environment in which they live, recognize how it developed, and offer ideas about how it should grow.
